A brush applies a series of data to a paper using a graph to get the coordinates. 

paper = Raphael();

grid = Grid({ width: 800, height: 600, margin: [ 50, 50, 50, 50 ], yMin: 0, yMax: 100, xLabels: ['Animal', 'Vegetable', 'Mineral'] })

for each brushType:
	brush = brushes[brushType](paper, grid);
	brush.stroke(data);

A brush can draw bars or lines or labels or floating bubbles or whatever. A complete chart will be composed by many brushes. 

A chart will read its options and data to create the grid and paper. It will then create brushes and call stroke() on each one.

AllyChartWidget:
	- should pass a proper grid to a mock brush
	- should pass a proper paper to a mock brush
	- should pass the data to a mock brush
	- should loop and do the above with three mock brushes
Grid:
	- easiest to test, no dependencies 
	- xForIndex(i), yForIndex(i)
	- xForValue(v), yForValue(v)
	- columnWidth(), rowHeight()
Brush:
	- depends on grid, paper, which will both be mocked for testing
	- should call the right methods on paper to draw bars, labels, or whatever it does
	
	
	
1. Create Grid.
2. Create Widget that sets up a very simple Paper and Grid and passes them to each brush.
3. Create each of the brushes. 	



$('div').allyChart({
	data: [10, 20, 40],
	brushes: [
		'bar',
		'x-axis-labels',
		'y-axis-units',
		'floating-labels',
		function(paper, grid) { return { stroke: function(data) { ... } }; }
	]
});

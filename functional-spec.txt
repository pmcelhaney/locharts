Investor Relations Stock Chart Functional Spec

1 Timeframe Form
	1.1 The timeframe form consists of two datepickers, labelled "From:" and "To:", 
	    specifying the first and last day of data to display.
    1.2 The two dates are inclusive, e.g. a selection of 05/18/2011 to 05/20/2011  
        includes the 18th, 19th and 20th May 2011.
    1.3 The datepicker is constrained to weekdays. Weekends should be disabled.
    1.3.2 Holidays MAY be disabled, but it's not a requirement.
    1.3.3 Dates before the first data point or after the last should be disabled 
          in the datepicker.
    1.3.4 If a date is typed into the text field (rather than selected from the
          datepicker), any valid date should be accepted, even if it's a weekend
          or out of range.

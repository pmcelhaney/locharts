•	Provide key stakeholders (institutional investors, financial analysts, journalists) with information that will help them gain an understanding of the company’s financial performance 
•	Keep in mind the secondary goal of the site copy – to reduce information requests to Investor Relations and the Corporate Communications team 
•	Promotional or marketing-oriented spin is to be avoided in the Investor Relations content.  The copy should be professional/business like (dejargonators are not necessary for this audience)
